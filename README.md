Thanks for installing the Paladin's Pack Beta Branch!
This is mainly to help hold over the admittedly long time between updates by letting you guys download the work early, albeit with possibly unfinished textures.
To install, just make a folder in documents/my games/terraria/resourcepacks and put the contents from this folder into there!
